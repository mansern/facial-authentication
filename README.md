# Facial Authentication

A simple repository developed in Reactjs and Vite to demonstrate how to implement Facial Authentication using FaceIO. FaceIO is an easy to implement, secure, and adaptable Passwordless Authentication & Authorization framework for web applications powered by Face Recognition.

# What is Facial Recognition?

Facial recognition is one of the latest authentication techniques, and many developers are adopting it these days. Facial recognition reduces the hassle of entering your email-password or any other user credentials to log in to a web application.

Facial recognition technology uses artificial intelligence to figure out the unique facial details of a user and store them as a random hash to reduce privacy-related issues.
